🧠 Reflection (50–100 words)

Building this portfolio taught me how to use React Router, reusable components, and accessibility best practices. The biggest challenge was managing state across different components and ensuring everything stayed responsive and accessible. My favorite addition was the collapsible “More Info” section and the dark/light theme toggle. Overall, this project helped me understand how real developer portfolios are built and polished.
